 *WARNING: 1-D or 2-D elements may cause problems in steady state calculations
           ensure that point loads defined in a *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS step
           and applied to nodes belonging to 1-D or 2-D elements have been
           applied to the same nodes in the preceding FREQUENCY step with
