*STEP
</H2>

<P>
Keyword type: step

<P>
This card describes the start of a new STEP. PERTURBATION, NLGEOM, INC, INCF,
THERMAL NETWORK and AMPLITUDE are the optional parameters. 

<P>
The parameter PERTURBATION is allowed for *FREQUENCY, *BUCKLE, *GREEN and *STATIC steps
only (for *STATIC steps it only makes sense for submodel frequency
calculations with preload, else a genuine nonlinear geometric calculation with
NLGEOM is recommended). If it is specified, the last *STATIC step is taken as reference state
and used to calculate the stiffness matrix. This means the inclusion of
previous deformations (large deformation stiffness) and the inclusion of
previous loads as preloads (stress stiffness), taking the temperatures into
account to determine the material properties. The active loads (mechanical and thermal) are those specified in the perturbation step. At the end of the step the perturbation load is reset to zero.

<P>
The loading active in a non-perturbative step is the accumulation of the loading in all previous steps since but not including the last perturbation step (or, if none has occurred, since the start of the calculation), unless OP=NEW has been specified since.

<P>
If NLGEOM is specified, the calculation takes geometrically nonlinear effects
into account. To this end a nonlinear strain tensor is used (Lagrangian strain
for hyperelastic materials, Eulerian strain for deformation plasticity and the
deviatoric elastic left Cauchy-Green tensor for incremental plasticity), the
step is divided into increments and a Newton iteration is performed within
each increment (notice that iterations are also performed for other kinds of
nonlinearity, such as material nonlinearity or contact conditions). Although the internally used stresses are the Piola stresses
of the second kind, they are transformed into Cauchy (true) stresses before
being printed. NLGEOM is only taken into account if the procedure card (such
as *STATIC, *DYNAMIC, *COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT) allows for it (the
*FREQUENCY card, for example, does not directly allow for it). Once the NLGEOM
parameter has been selected, it remains active in all subsequent static
calculations. With NLGEOM=NO the inclusion of geometrically nonlinear effects
can be turned off. It stays active in subsequent steps as well, unless NLGEOM
was specified again. To check whether geometric nonlinearity was taken into
account in a specific step, look for the message ``Nonlinear geometric effects
are taken into account'' in the output.

<P>
The step size
and the increment size can be specified underneath the procedure card. The maximum
number of increments in the step (for automatic incrementation) can be
specified by using the parameter INC (default is 100) for thermomechanical
calculations and INCF (default is 10000) for 3D fluid calculations. In coupled
fluid-structure calculations INC applies to the thermomechanical part of the
computations and INCF to the 3D fluid part.

<P>
The option THERMAL NETWORK allows the user to perform fast thermal
calculations despite the use of specific network elements (e.g. gas pipers,
labyrinths etc), which are characterized by a TYPE description on the
<A HREF="node264.html#fluidsection">*FLUID SECTION</A> card. In general, the use of specific
network elements triggers the alternating solution of the network and the
structure, leading to longer computational times. In thermal calculations with
only generic network elements (no TYPE specified on the *FLUID SECTION cards),
the temperatures in the network are solved simulaneously with the
temperatures on the structural side (which is much faster than the alternating
way). Now, sometimes the user would like to use
specific elements, despite the fact that only temperatures have to be
calculated, e.g. in order to determine the heat transfer coefficients based on
flow characteristics such as Prandl and Reynolds number (this requires the use
of the user film routine film.f). Specifying THERMAL NETWORK on the FIRST
*STEP card in the input deck takes care that in such a case the simulaneous
solving procedure is used instead of the alternating one.

<P>
Finally, the parameter AMPLITUDE can be used to define whether the loading in
this step should be ramped (AMPLITUDE=RAMP) or stepped (AMPLITUDE=STEP). With
this option the default for the procedure can be overwritten. For example, the
default for a *STATIC step is RAMP. By specifying AMPLITUDE=STEP the loading
in the static step is applied completely at the beginning of the step. Note,
however, that amplitudes on 
the individual loading cards (such as *CLOAD, *BOUNDARY....) take precedence.

<P>
starts a step and increases the maximum number of thermomechanical increments
to complete the step to 1000. The maximum number of 3D fluid increments is set
to 20000 and for the turbulence model the SST model was chosen.
